      "I'm 19, going on 20 in six days. I don't need to tell you that \"Toy Story\" is a movie tailor-made for the kiddies, but there's a special reservation for adults too. I should know, as should anyone who views it with an open mind. We've all had our favorite toys. For guys, like me, there's a 90% chance you played with either Transformers or G.I. Joe or Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles or all three when you were six, seven, eight, or nine years-old. For me, it was Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles and Godzilla action figures. I'd always imagine living out wild fantasy adventures in my room or basement; ah, the joy of being a kid again. But that's part of \"Toy Story's\" fun appeal. It gives you a chance to relive your childhood again. Today I saw for the first time in about eight years and it's still just as fresh and inventive as Pixar, probably the best film studio in computer animation, conceived it back in 1995. In the room of young Andy, the toys are alive - when he's not present of course, and cowboy Woody (voiced by Tom Hanks) is the boy's favorite item. But all that changes on Andy's birthday and a new toy given to him on that day captures the boy's heart - Buzz Lightyear (voiced by Tim Allen). Of course, any replacement of this sort inspires jealousy, and pretty soon Buzz is the new \"it\" item of the bedroom. Andy's given into everything Buzz Lightyear, even new bedsheets - bedsheets! - leaving poor Woody on the short end of the stick. But the thing is, Buzz has trouble believing he's just a simple toy and nothing more, as he thinks he's actually BUZZ LIGHTYEAR! It also seems this couldn't have come at a worse time for the toys, as Andy and his mother are moving away, which is causing all sorts of chaos as Woody tries to get everything organized so nobody is left behind, and that's exactly what happens with rivals Woody and Buzz, who are misplaced and must find their beloved Andy before they move. Not only that, they must also battle Sid, the serial killer in-training kid that lives next door and tortures toys. As directed by John Lasseter and his army of screenwriters including himself, Andrew Stanton (who would co-direct Pixar's future hit \"Finding Nemo\" in 2003) and Joel Cohen, \"Toy Story\" is true imaginative fantasy realized in superb animation. It more than brings the kid in you to the surface, it makes you want to be a kid again, as many toys have cameos including Army Men (including the Sergeant who's voiced by R. Lee Ermey) and Mr. Potato Head (voiced by Don Rickles). I love \"Toy Story,\" and I think anyone who views it thoughtfully will love it too.10/10\n",

      "This was the first Pixar movie I've seen. I remember seeing it back 10 years ago, back when it was new. Back then Pixar wasn't too well known in the world. This movie made their intro and beginning of their long line of great movies.Not only was it Pixar's first movie, but it was also the first ever CGI Movie ever made. Back then I didn't know what CGI was so I didn't had a clue how they even made the movie itself(I was only 7 when I first watched it in theaters).The story to this movie is unlike anything you've seen before. It all has to do with what do Toys do when no one is around to play with them. It features memorable characters and some existing toys like \"Little Tykes, Mr. Potatoe Head, Slinky, Barrel of monkeys, etc.\" The main character is Woody a classic Cowboy doll who is the favorite toy of Andy, a kind and good boy. He gets respect and pride from the other toys. Life seems good for him.Till one day on Andy's Birthday, he receives a special toy that any boy would want a \"Buzz Lightyear\" action figure. Who has cool features that not even Woody has. And Woody fears Buzz will be Andy's new favorite toy and lose his respect and pride with the other toys.Toy story has some laughs, excitement, and great visuals for a Well done CGI movie. Every Animation lover should see this movie. If you like this movie, you'll like the sequel even more.I give it an 8/10 perfect movie for the whole family to watch.\n",

      "Remember the original Pixar movies? Remember when Pixar didn't have stereotypical surfers and rappers? It was when the characters were fun and familiar. They didn't waste out time with farting jokes, but instead had smart jokes that weren't overdone. (even if they were more geared towards adults.) Luckily, we still have one good, classic Pixar movie; Toy Story. Peter Doctor knows how to make a fun and enjoyable family movie.Woody, is the \"top toy\" of Andy's bedroom. He leads meeting and events, and is one of the most popular toys there. But, then, Andy has a birthday party. Everybody is worried about getting replaced by a toy, but Woody assures them that there is nothing to be worried about. Funny, how he ends up getting replaced by Buzz Lightyear-the new popular toy. Ironic, huh? So, he gets jealous and tries to kill Buzz, by setting up a trap and pushing him out the window. Then, the other toys find out, and think \"Let's kill Woody!\" Wow, the irony in it all! The only way the toys will forgive him, is if he brings Buzz back. So, Woody and Buzz meet up at \"Pizza Palace.\" After exploring a bit, they get caught by Sid-the sick and twisted kid next door.But, what makes this movie so good? Toy Story isn't your average kids' film. It seems to have a message in it all. Two unlikely friends, Buzz and Woody hate each other at first. Then, they slowly learn trust each other, and stick together through thick and thin.Toy Story is perhaps one of those \"feel good\" movies. It's fun, and doesn't try to be anything it's not. Toy Story is an enjoyable, fun, and all-around excellent film. Be sure to put it on your \"To Watch\" list.10/10\n",

      "When Toy Story came, in 1995,I was 9 years old and it was a remarkable animation;Pixar wasn't famous like today, and we didn't have movies like Shrek and Finding Nemo. But I have to say that even in the present days this movie is awesome and has great graphics. Only to start, the story: The toys have life of their own, and every time we humans are distant from them, they have their lives and their own plans. Woody, until Buzz LightYear comes up,was Andy's favorite toy and also the leader of all of them. Jealous of Buzz's fame, Woody tries to get a rid of him, and because of that is totally ignored by the others toys, who once were his friends and admired him. Looking what he did, Woody goes search Buzz and them many adventures happen.\n",

      "when toy story came in 1995 i was 9 years old and it was a remarkable animation pixar was not famous like today and we did not have movies like shrek and finding nemo but i have to say that even in the present days this movie is awesome and has great graphics only to start the story the toys have life of their own and every time we humans are distant from them they have their lives and their own plans woody until buzz lightyear comes up was andy s favorite toy and also the leader of all of them jealous of buzz s fame woody tries to get a rid of him and because of that is totally ignored by the others toys who once were his friends and admired him looking what he did woody goes search buzz and them many adventures happen\n",

      "PIXAR animation was but an experimental animation company that had a track record of short film contributions to film festivals when Disney invested in and ultimately released their first project,Toy Story. I figured Disney probably had a good feeling about this one,but I'm not sure they anticipated the kind of groundbreaking swell of animation this would shepherd in.The concept is a fitfully simple and cute one: when kids are away,their toys take on personalities and lives of their own,plotting,planning,bickering,reacting,flirting,etc. In this particular den of toys, a Cowboy Woody doll(voiced by Tom Hanks) is the leader,flanked by a Slinky dog(Jim Varney),green toy soldiers(aptly casted R.Lee Ermey as their platoon leader),a Mr.Potato head(Don Rickles), a Piggy bank(John Ratzenberger,forever Cliff Claven from \"Cheers\") and a Bo Peep doll(Annie Potts). Into the mix is a new,electronic Buzz Lightyear action figure(Tim Allen,who probably does the best voice acting of the bunch here),who almost instantly wows the locals and stirs jealousy from Woody.With music from Randy Newmann--a personal fave of mine--this movie's colors,attention to detail and wry humor make it easily adaptable to kids and adults alike. CAn it really be ten years since this film broke new ground on animation? How time flies in the wake of stuff like \"Shrek\" and \"FInding Nemo\"!\n",
