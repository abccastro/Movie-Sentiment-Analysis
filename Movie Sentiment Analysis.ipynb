      "What is it that makes a great horror movie? There has to be a lot of spooks and thrills that make it scary of course. But it cannot be cheesy with a thin plot. There has to be a good, believable story...at least a good story. It has to be something you can follow along with and enjoy. Throw all of this together and you have yourself a horror movie. Today's horror movies focus on special effects and sometimes gory images that sometimes make you laugh. All of these films try to duplicate what the original horror film did. Flat out creep you out. Nosferatu did just that.Nosferatu is the essential horror movie. Filmed in 1922, it was a silent picture starring Max Schrek as Count Orlok, the vampire based on Dracula from Bram Stoker's classic novel about a vampire who moves from his castle to the city after a visit by Jonathon Hutter. This unauthorized version of Stoker's classic features Schrek as the thin, creepy, blood-sucking vampire. The story unfolds as Harker tries to settle the deal with the Count so he can move into his new home...right near Hutter. Little does he know that the Count is a vampire. After a close encounter after dinner with Orlok, Hutter is convinced that this guy is out for blood...literally. Now Orlok is moving into Hutter's town of Bremen, bringing in with him the plague. Hutter and his wife are dragged into this ordeal with Orlok. Along with the rest of the town, Orlok and the plague turn the town upside down.What makes this film so impressive is the result of Orlok's terrifying secret. Since Hutter does not know that he is a vampire, his expression of sheer horror when he finds out makes the movie kind of realistic. Although the thought of a person who drinks blood is preposterous, it is still scary as hell! Just the appearance of Count Orlok is frightening. There is a scene when Hutter realizes what the Count is and he opens the door to see him just standing there. The camera zooms in and he is just standing there. His hands at his side, nightcap off exposing his bald head and pointy ears. The sharp, narrow fangs hang down as if ready to bite your neck. Dracula is a familiar tale told for many years, but this portrayal is very scary, the silence is even scary.Although Bela Lugosi is known for the role of Count Dracula nine years after the release of Nosferatu, it was this movie that really got the Dracula fascination started. Nosferatu will continue to inspire and creep out all who watch it.\n",

      "The cast of the original series join with \"Space Seed\" survivor Khan(Ricardo Montalban), Paul Winfield(The Terminator), bye bye Besch, and newcomer Kirstie Alley in the most well rounded of the Star Trek films. The battle scenes, supported by an exciting James Horner score, come alive through good visuals and top notch editing. Ricardo Montalban flexes his mighty pecks, quotes Moby penis, and utters a certain old Klingon proverb. Nicholas Meyer, writer of Star Trek 2, 4, and 6, leaves behind the carcass of the first film and starts a trilogy arc that is the most human of the series. The themes of life from death and an old enemy reviving a tired hero mirrors the production of the film. The scene where Spock is shot onto the Genesis planet as Amazing Grace plays in the background gets me every time. This is the apex of the original series of movies and probably in the entire series.Khan: \"Kirk, I wonder if you are familiar with the old Klingon proverb that revenge is a dish best served cold. (leans forward) It is very cold, in space! (music swells)\"\n",

      "Anthony Hopkins as billionaire Charles Morse has outperformed the wily role of Alec Balwin as Robert Green. Hopkins dialog delivery is far better and his portrayal of a cool and calm Morse who is fatally stranded in a death defying jungle with his naive and immature team mates is by far commendable.Tamahori has excellently directed the final fight scene with the freak man eating bear which was well dealt with the audacious sagacity of Charles Morse. The brave, kind and selfless Morse tried his best to safely rescue Robert Green but he failed to deliver because of the negative and selfish intent of his colleague who was all out to take his wife and billions from his magnanimous friend. Hopkins at his best and the jungle at its cruelest.Moral : Goodness Rewarded & Bravery Awarded.\n",

      "Joh Carpenter directs this early 80's Stephen King book, of a harried student, who vents Revenge, with a spooky car with a life of its' own.Have you ever been the victim of a school Bully or Bullies ? Did your parents repress your growth cycle, then this movie is for you .High School student Arnie Cunningham(Keith Gordon) has problems , lots of problems ! His parents will not let him grow up, Bullies pick on him at will, and no one REALLY understands him, so what is a young boy to do?, buy a haunted car , restore it and get REVENGE, a perfect formula and vehicle, forgive the pun, for which to give John Carpenter, license ,SORRY,..... to work with .Keith Gordon gives a good performance as the misunderstood teen.Director John delivers a decent effort of a Stephen King novel, with John Stockwell as Dennis Guilder and Alexandra Paul as Leigh Cabot, the misunderstood girlfriend of Arnie. Both actors give good performances, as the good side of the track students, who try to give Arnie the support he needs, to overcome the teenage obstacles that have embraced him.Well, that only goes so far, so Arnie finds solace in Christine , a 1958 Plymouth Fury, which plays 1950's music to display its' feelings of the moment...interesting.As the plot goes , the Bullies get more abrasive and attack Christine at will,at the shop where Arnie restored Christine to its' glory days..Arnie and Christine develop a \"Special \" relationship, and they almost become one in thought !So the haunted car goes on the Attack , getting Arnie the Revenge he was seeking. Sort of interesting, could have used a better music score. His friends see Arnie becoming more distant and try to bring him back to reality. Anyway, if you are looking for a ghostly movie with teenagers of angst, then this movie is for you .This movie rates 7 of 10 , see with a double feature with \"Fright Night\" . more teenagers , more angst, a lot of fun !!!\n",

      "My rating of 10/10 applies to the fact that it is so neat to see Boris Karloff and Vincent Price in a movie together, and in one with Peter Lorre and Jack Nicholson at that! Price and Lorre play magicians Erasmus Craven and Adolphus Bedlo, who battle against the nefarious Dr. Scarabus (Boris Karloff). The climax has Craven and Scarabus one-upping each other.It is hard to believe that Jack Nicholson - as Bedlo's son - was once young, but it looks like he was. And he was under-acting in relation to his usual roles. It must have been fun for him to get to co-star with Vincent Price.Vincent Price...probably the only horror star in history who made a guest appearance on \"The Brady Bunch\".\n",

      "What is it that makes a great horror movie? There has to be a lot of spooks and thrills that make it scary of course. But it cannot be cheesy with a thin plot. There has to be a good, believable story...at least a good story. It has to be something you can follow along with and enjoy. Throw all of this together and you have yourself a horror movie. Today's horror movies focus on special effects and sometimes gory images that sometimes make you laugh. All of these films try to duplicate what the original horror film did. Flat out creep you out. Nosferatu did just that.Nosferatu is the essential horror movie. Filmed in 1922, it was a silent picture starring Max Schrek as Count Orlok, the vampire based on Dracula from Bram Stoker's classic novel about a vampire who moves from his castle to the city after a visit by Jonathon Hutter. This unauthorized version of Stoker's classic features Schrek as the thin, creepy, blood-sucking vampire. The story unfolds as Harker tries to settle the deal with the Count so he can move into his new home...right near Hutter. Little does he know that the Count is a vampire. After a close encounter after dinner with Orlok, Hutter is convinced that this guy is out for blood...literally. Now Orlok is moving into Hutter's town of Bremen, bringing in with him the plague. Hutter and his wife are dragged into this ordeal with Orlok. Along with the rest of the town, Orlok and the plague turn the town upside down.What makes this film so impressive is the result of Orlok's terrifying secret. Since Hutter does not know that he is a vampire, his expression of sheer horror when he finds out makes the movie kind of realistic. Although the thought of a person who drinks blood is preposterous, it is still scary as hell! Just the appearance of Count Orlok is frightening. There is a scene when Hutter realizes what the Count is and he opens the door to see him just standing there. The camera zooms in and he is just standing there. His hands at his side, nightcap off exposing his bald head and pointy ears. The sharp, narrow fangs hang down as if ready to bite your neck. Dracula is a familiar tale told for many years, but this portrayal is very scary, the silence is even scary.Although Bela Lugosi is known for the role of Count Dracula nine years after the release of Nosferatu, it was this movie that really got the Dracula fascination started. Nosferatu will continue to inspire and creep out all who watch it.\n",

      "The cast of the original series join with \"Space Seed\" survivor Khan(Ricardo Montalban), Paul Winfield(The Terminator), bye bye Besch, and newcomer Kirstie Alley in the most well rounded of the Star Trek films. The battle scenes, supported by an exciting James Horner score, come alive through good visuals and top notch editing. Ricardo Montalban flexes his mighty pecks, quotes Moby penis, and utters a certain old Klingon proverb. Nicholas Meyer, writer of Star Trek 2, 4, and 6, leaves behind the carcass of the first film and starts a trilogy arc that is the most human of the series. The themes of life from death and an old enemy reviving a tired hero mirrors the production of the film. The scene where Spock is shot onto the Genesis planet as Amazing Grace plays in the background gets me every time. This is the apex of the original series of movies and probably in the entire series.Khan: \"Kirk, I wonder if you are familiar with the old Klingon proverb that revenge is a dish best served cold.

      "What is it that makes a great horror movie? There has to be a lot of spooks and thrills that make it scary of course. But it cannot be cheesy with a thin plot. There has to be a good, believable story...at least a good story. It has to be something you can follow along with and enjoy. Throw all of this together and you have yourself a horror movie. Today's horror movies focus on special effects and sometimes gory images that sometimes make you laugh. All of these films try to duplicate what the original horror film did. Flat out creep you out. Nosferatu did just that.Nosferatu is the essential horror movie. Filmed in 1922, it was a silent picture starring Max Schrek as Count Orlok, the vampire based on Dracula from Bram Stoker's classic novel about a vampire who moves from his castle to the city after a visit by Jonathon Hutter. This unauthorized version of Stoker's classic features Schrek as the thin, creepy, blood-sucking vampire. The story unfolds as Harker tries to settle the deal with the Count so he can move into his new home...right near Hutter. Little does he know that the Count is a vampire. After a close encounter after dinner with Orlok, Hutter is convinced that this guy is out for blood...literally. Now Orlok is moving into Hutter's town of Bremen, bringing in with him the plague. Hutter and his wife are dragged into this ordeal with Orlok. Along with the rest of the town, Orlok and the plague turn the town upside down.What makes this film so impressive is the result of Orlok's terrifying secret. Since Hutter does not know that he is a vampire, his expression of sheer horror when he finds out makes the movie kind of realistic. Although the thought of a person who drinks blood is preposterous, it is still scary as hell! Just the appearance of Count Orlok is frightening. There is a scene when Hutter realizes what the Count is and he opens the door to see him just standing there. The camera zooms in and he is just standing there. His hands at his side, nightcap off exposing his bald head and pointy ears. The sharp, narrow fangs hang down as if ready to bite your neck. Dracula is a familiar tale told for many years, but this portrayal is very scary, the silence is even scary.Although Bela Lugosi is known for the role of Count Dracula nine years after the release of Nosferatu, it was this movie that really got the Dracula fascination started. Nosferatu will continue to inspire and creep out all who watch it.\n",

      "The cast of the original series join with \"Space Seed\" survivor Khan(Ricardo Montalban), Paul Winfield(The Terminator), bye bye Besch, and newcomer Kirstie Alley in the most well rounded of the Star Trek films. The battle scenes, supported by an exciting James Horner score, come alive through good visuals and top notch editing. Ricardo Montalban flexes his mighty pecks, quotes Moby penis, and utters a certain old Klingon proverb. Nicholas Meyer, writer of Star Trek 2, 4, and 6, leaves behind the carcass of the first film and starts a trilogy arc that is the most human of the series. The themes of life from death and an old enemy reviving a tired hero mirrors the production of the film. The scene where Spock is shot onto the Genesis planet as Amazing Grace plays in the background gets me every time. This is the apex of the original series of movies and probably in the entire series.Khan: \"Kirk, I wonder if you are familiar with the old Klingon proverb that revenge is a dish best served cold. (leans forward) It is very cold, in space! (music swells)\"\n",

      "Anthony Hopkins as billionaire Charles Morse has outperformed the wily role of Alec Balwin as Robert Green. Hopkins dialog delivery is far better and his portrayal of a cool and calm Morse who is fatally stranded in a death defying jungle with his naive and immature team mates is by far commendable.Tamahori has excellently directed the final fight scene with the freak man eating bear which was well dealt with the audacious sagacity of Charles Morse. The brave, kind and selfless Morse tried his best to safely rescue Robert Green but he failed to deliver because of the negative and selfish intent of his colleague who was all out to take his wife and billions from his magnanimous friend. Hopkins at his best and the jungle at its cruelest.Moral : Goodness Rewarded & Bravery Awarded.\n",

Did your parents repress your growth cycle, then this movie is for you .High School student Arnie Cunningham(Keith Gordon) has problems , lots of problems ! His parents will not let him grow up, Bullies pick on him at will, and no one REALLY understands him, so what is a young boy to do?, buy a haunted car , restore it and get REVENGE, a perfect formula and vehicle, forgive the pun, for which to give John Carpenter, license ,SORRY,..... to work with .Keith Gordon gives a good performance as the misunderstood teen.Director John delivers a decent effort of a Stephen King novel, with John Stockwell as Dennis Guilder and Alexandra Paul as Leigh Cabot, the misunderstood girlfriend of Arnie. Both actors give good performances, as the good side of the track students, who try to give Arnie the support he needs, to overcome the teenage obstacles that have embraced him.Well, that only goes so far, so Arnie finds solace in Christine , a 1958 Plymouth Fury, which plays 1950's music to display its' feelings of the moment...interesting.As the plot goes , the Bullies get more abrasive and attack Christine at will,at the shop where Arnie restored Christine to its' glory days..Arnie and Christine develop a \"Special \" relationship, and they almost become one in thought !So the haunted car goes on the Attack , getting Arnie the Revenge he was seeking. Sort of interesting, could have used a better music score. His friends see Arnie becoming more distant and try to bring him back to reality. Anyway, if you are looking for a ghostly movie with teenagers of angst, then this movie is for you .This movie rates 7 of 10 , see with a double feature with \"Fright Night\" . more teenagers , more angst, a lot of fun !!!\n",

      "What is it that makes a great horror movie? There has to be a lot of spooks and thrills that make it scary of course. But it cannot be cheesy with a thin plot. There has to be a good, believable story...at least a good story. It has to be something you can follow along with and enjoy. Throw all of this together and you have yourself a horror movie. Today's horror movies focus on special effects and sometimes gory images that sometimes make you laugh. All of these films try to duplicate what the original horror film did. Flat out creep you out. Nosferatu did just that.Nosferatu is the essential horror movie. Filmed in 1922, it was a silent picture starring Max Schrek as Count Orlok, the vampire based on Dracula from Bram Stoker's classic novel about a vampire who moves from his castle to the city after a visit by Jonathon Hutter. This unauthorized version of Stoker's classic features Schrek as the thin, creepy, blood-sucking vampire. The story unfolds as Harker tries to settle the deal with the Count so he can move into his new home...right near Hutter. Little does he know that the Count is a vampire. After a close encounter after dinner with Orlok, Hutter is convinced that this guy is out for blood...literally. Now Orlok is moving into Hutter's town of Bremen, bringing in with him the plague. Hutter and his wife are dragged into this ordeal with Orlok. Along with the rest of the town, Orlok and the plague turn the town upside down.What makes this film so impressive is the result of Orlok's terrifying secret. Since Hutter does not know that he is a vampire, his expression of sheer horror when he finds out makes the movie kind of realistic. Although the thought of a person who drinks blood is preposterous, it is still scary as hell! Just the appearance of Count Orlok is frightening. There is a scene when Hutter realizes what the Count is and he opens the door to see him just standing there. The camera zooms in and he is just standing there. His hands at his side, nightcap off exposing his bald head and pointy ears. The sharp, narrow fangs hang down as if ready to bite your neck. Dracula is a familiar tale told for many years, but this portrayal is very scary, the silence is even scary.Although Bela Lugosi is known for the role of Count Dracula nine years after the release of Nosferatu, it was this movie that really got the Dracula fascination started. Nosferatu will continue to inspire and creep out all who watch it.\n",

      "What is it that makes a great horror movie? There has to be a lot of spooks and thrills that make it scary of course. But it cannot be cheesy with a thin plot. There has to be a good, believable story...at least a good story. It has to be something you can follow along with and enjoy. Throw all of this together and you have yourself a horror movie. Today's horror movies focus on special effects and sometimes gory images that sometimes make you laugh. All of these films try to duplicate what the original horror film did. Flat out creep you out. Nosferatu did just that.Nosferatu is the essential horror movie. Filmed in 1922, it was a silent picture starring Max Schrek as Count Orlok, the vampire based on Dracula from Bram Stoker's classic novel about a vampire who moves from his castle to the city after a visit by Jonathon Hutter. This unauthorized version of Stoker's classic features Schrek as the thin, creepy, blood-sucking vampire. The story unfolds as Harker tries to settle the deal with the Count so he can move into his new home...right near Hutter. Little does he know that the Count is a vampire. After a close encounter after dinner with Orlok, Hutter is convinced that this guy is out for blood...literally. Now Orlok is moving into Hutter's town of Bremen, bringing in with him the plague. Hutter and his wife are dragged into this ordeal with Orlok. Along with the rest of the town, Orlok and the plague turn the town upside down.What makes this film so impressive is the result of Orlok's terrifying secret. Since Hutter does not know that he is a vampire, his expression of sheer horror when he finds out makes the movie kind of realistic. Although the thought of a person who drinks blood is preposterous, it is still scary as hell! Just the appearance of Count Orlok is frightening. There is a scene when Hutter realizes what the Count is and he opens the door to see him just standing there. The camera zooms in and he is just standing there. His hands at his side, nightcap off exposing his bald head and pointy ears. The sharp, narrow fangs hang down as if ready to bite your neck. Dracula is a familiar tale told for many years, but this portrayal is very scary, the silence is even scary.Although Bela Lugosi is known for the role of Count Dracula nine years after the release of Nosferatu, it was this movie that really got the Dracula fascination started. Nosferatu will continue to inspire and creep out all who watch it.\n",

      "The cast of the original series join with \"Space Seed\" survivor Khan(Ricardo Montalban), Paul Winfield(The Terminator), bye bye Besch, and newcomer Kirstie Alley in the most well rounded of the Star Trek films. The battle scenes, supported by an exciting James Horner score, come alive through good visuals and top notch editing. Ricardo Montalban flexes his mighty pecks, quotes Moby penis, and utters a certain old Klingon proverb. Nicholas Meyer, writer of Star Trek 2, 4, and 6, leaves behind the carcass of the first film and starts a trilogy arc that is the most human of the series. The themes of life from death and an old enemy reviving a tired hero mirrors the production of the film. The scene where Spock is shot onto the Genesis planet as Amazing Grace plays in the background gets me every time. This is the apex of the original series of movies and probably in the entire series.Khan: \"Kirk, I wonder if you are familiar with the old Klingon proverb that revenge is a dish best served cold. (leans forward) It is very cold, in space! (music swells)\"\n",

      "Anthony Hopkins as billionaire Charles Morse has outperformed the wily role of Alec Balwin as Robert Green. Hopkins dialog delivery is far better and his portrayal of a cool and calm Morse who is fatally stranded in a death defying jungle with his naive and immature team mates is by far commendable.Tamahori has excellently directed the final fight scene with the freak man eating bear which was well dealt with the audacious sagacity of Charles Morse. The brave, kind and selfless Morse tried his best to safely rescue Robert Green but he failed to deliver because of the negative and selfish intent of his colleague who was all out to take his wife and billions from his magnanimous friend. Hopkins at his best and the jungle at its cruelest.Moral : Goodness Rewarded & Bravery Awarded.\n",

      "Joh Carpenter directs this early 80's Stephen King book, of a harried student, who vents Revenge, with a spooky car with a life of its' own.Have you ever been the victim of a school Bully or Bullies ? Did your parents repress your growth cycle, then this movie is for you .High School student Arnie Cunningham(Keith Gordon) has problems , lots of problems ! His parents will not let him grow up, Bullies pick on him at will, and no one REALLY understands him, so what is a young boy to do?, buy a haunted car , restore it and get REVENGE, a perfect formula and vehicle, forgive the pun, for which to give John Carpenter, license ,SORRY,..... to work with .Keith Gordon gives a good performance as the misunderstood teen.Director John delivers a decent effort of a Stephen King novel, with John Stockwell as Dennis Guilder and Alexandra Paul as Leigh Cabot, the misunderstood girlfriend of Arnie. Both actors give good performances, as the good side of the track students, who try to give Arnie the support he needs, to overcome the teenage obstacles that have embraced him.Well, that only goes so far, so Arnie finds solace in Christine , a 1958 Plymouth Fury, which plays 1950's music to display its' feelings of the moment...interesting.As the plot goes , the Bullies get more abrasive and attack Christine at will,at the shop where Arnie restored Christine to its' glory days..Arnie and Christine develop a \"Special \" relationship, and they almost become one in thought !So the haunted car goes on the Attack , getting Arnie the Revenge he was seeking. Sort of interesting, could have used a better music score. His friends see Arnie becoming more distant and try to bring him back to reality. Anyway, if you are looking for a ghostly movie with teenagers of angst, then this movie is for you .This movie rates 7 of 10 , see with a double feature with \"Fright Night\" . more teenagers , more angst, a lot of fun !!!\n",

      "My rating of 10/10 applies to the fact that it is so neat to see Boris Karloff and Vincent Price in a movie together, and in one with Peter Lorre and Jack Nicholson at that! Price and Lorre play magicians Erasmus Craven and Adolphus Bedlo, who battle against the nefarious Dr. Scarabus (Boris Karloff). The climax has Craven and Scarabus one-upping each other.It is hard to believe that Jack Nicholson - as Bedlo's son - was once young, but it looks like he was. And he was under-acting in relation to his usual roles. It must have been fun for him to get to co-star with Vincent Price.Vincent Price...probably the only horror star in history who made a guest appearance on \"The Brady Bunch\".\n",
