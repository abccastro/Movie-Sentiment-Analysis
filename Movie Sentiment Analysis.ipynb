      "There's a Website called FearDotCom and anyone who visits it and accepts its challenge will die 48hours later. After someone dies of strange circumstances detective Mike Reilly (Stephen Dorff) gets the strange case and a Health Inspector (Natascha McElhone) is brought in too, as they think that they might be dealing with a new virus. Though, soon later the two come across the Website and race against the clock to solve the mystery before they become a victim of the site. While, all this is happening a psychopath (Stephen Rae) is kidnapping girls and torturing them live on the net. So, is there any connection between the two activities? Does this idea ring a bell, it sure does. Flimsy rip-off comes straight to mind while watching this very bland and trashy film, despite director William Malone's best efforts. Elements from other (better) films show up and you just can't deny it or even forgive it for being uninspiring. Though, actually I didn't hate it, but I could've gone without seeing it. The premise starts off pretty interesting, but after that it just fizzles out. It just becomes tiresome and rather dull story telling, with uninspired performances from the leads that aren't capable of carrying a film and are hardly convincing in their roles. The plot doesn't make too much sense, with pointless subplots and no real cohesion. It does get very muddled with its ridiculous outcomes and it focusing on sequences that are full of tedium. When it reaches the pointless ending you'll think why did I bother? Not much of a mystery is achieved as no tension, atmosphere and detail is built. It basically rips off the plot of \"Ringu/The Ring\". Instead of a video it's now a haunted Website. You can also throw in ideas from \"Videodrome\" (the better of the three) into the mix. The script is fairly mortifying, with such trite dialogue coming out of the their mouths. The screenplay is plain unexciting and ineffective. Performances from the likes of Stephen Dorff, Natascha McElhone and Stephen Rae were by the numbers. They were just so uninteresting and unbelievable that you just didn't care for them. Look out for a small cameo from Jeffery Combs (Re-animator and From Beyond). What the film went for was slick visuals, potent camera-work and flashy editing. Visually it was good, though towards the end the whole treatment did kind of get annoying and incredibly repetitious. The look of the film was incredibly dark, with many gloomy sequences involving dimly lit corridors and rooms. Even the sombre mood or fine score couldn't help it raise any chills. The deaths scenes and torture moments are unimaginative and rather tame. It's glossily executed, but illogical and flat sums it up.\n",

I liked the first one but didn't really know everything that was going on, but just knowing that she set off the kill 5 individuals who left her dead at her wedding. So I saw Kill Bill: Vol 2 and liked it highly. The movie answered all of my questions to the previous one and had much of a better story and was not unrealistic that much. We finally get to see Bill, who is played by David Carradine who had a really good role in the movie. There is a great conclusion to the movie and had a very good story, along with likable characters, my favorite being Budd. Overall, good movie that answers tons of questions. I recommend Kill Bill Vol. 2.Hedeen's Outlook: 8/10 *** B\n",

      "There's a Website called FearDotCom and anyone who visits it and accepts its challenge will die 48hours later. After someone dies of strange circumstances detective Mike Reilly (Stephen Dorff) gets the strange case and a Health Inspector (Natascha McElhone) is brought in too, as they think that they might be dealing with a new virus. Though, soon later the two come across the Website and race against the clock to solve the mystery before they become a victim of the site. While, all this is happening a psychopath (Stephen Rae) is kidnapping girls and torturing them live on the net. So, is there any connection between the two activities? Does this idea ring a bell, it sure does. Flimsy rip-off comes straight to mind while watching this very bland and trashy film, despite director William Malone's best efforts. Elements from other (better) films show up and you just can't deny it or even forgive it for being uninspiring. Though, actually I didn't hate it, but I could've gone without seeing it. The premise starts off pretty interesting, but after that it just fizzles out. It just becomes tiresome and rather dull story telling, with uninspired performances from the leads that aren't capable of carrying a film and are hardly convincing in their roles. The plot doesn't make too much sense, with pointless subplots and no real cohesion. It does get very muddled with its ridiculous outcomes and it focusing on sequences that are full of tedium. When it reaches the pointless ending you'll think why did I bother? Not much of a mystery is achieved as no tension, atmosphere and detail is built. It basically rips off the plot of \"Ringu/The Ring\". Instead of a video it's now a haunted Website. You can also throw in ideas from \"Videodrome\" (the better of the three) into the mix. The script is fairly mortifying, with such trite dialogue coming out of the their mouths. The screenplay is plain unexciting and ineffective. Performances from the likes of Stephen Dorff, Natascha McElhone and Stephen Rae were by the numbers. They were just so uninteresting and unbelievable that you just didn't care for them. Look out for a small cameo from Jeffery Combs (Re-animator and From Beyond). What the film went for was slick visuals, potent camera-work and flashy editing. Visually it was good, though towards the end the whole treatment did kind of get annoying and incredibly repetitious. The look of the film was incredibly dark, with many gloomy sequences involving dimly lit corridors and rooms. Even the sombre mood or fine score couldn't help it raise any chills. The deaths scenes and torture moments are unimaginative and rather tame. It's glossily executed, but illogical and flat sums it up.\n",
