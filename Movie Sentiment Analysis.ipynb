      "When a \"serious\" movie is pitifully appalling, it is easy to write a comedic review. When a comedic movie falls into the same category, it is almost impossible to make sport of it Â– because any frivolity in the review may be misconstrued as comedic quality that the MOVIE possesses. So let me clarify from the outset: This \"comedy\" is not to be laughed at.Who would have thought that Mel Brooks Â– the genius writer/director behind Blazing Saddles, History Of The World and Young Frankenstein (a successful comedy movie wholly in the vein of this failed one Â– pun intended) Â– would be prone to helming a comedy as pitifully appalling as \"Dracula: Dead And Loving It\"? One imagines that Brooks' comic radar is so finely-attuned that he would have seen through the financial and corporate layers of this film's drudgery and simply either abandoned it and cut his losses when he saw that it was not working, or salvaged the potential high points and let the cutting room floor eat the rest.He did neither, which reveals that something is terribly askew in the Brooks universe. No longer is it \"good to be the king\" - Mel Brooks is merely an old man these days, his tastes no longer running congruent with his audience's; his comedy no longer as energetic or as biting as the wit of his youth (which, relatively speaking, was his late-40s anyway).The Brooks gag formulas are definitely still there, but seem lazily inserted as dependable fallback material, rather than inspired stylistic substance. Jokes which I can imagine my 15-year-old self repeating ad nauseam in the schoolyard, now fall flat and wearisome on inured sensibilities.Not only does the film suffer from rehashed and lazy gags, Brooks' direction lacks coherence and is oft-times merely cursory; there are wide shots, reverses and close-ups which serve no purpose, camera blandly flitting from one unnecessary shot to the next, not merely misdirecting our eye, but searching for subject matter to fill the frame judiciously. Many shots seem to be second-unit throwaway footage. Instead of easing back and letting the film's levity wash over me, as should have been the case, all these logistical details kept bugging my senses, detracting from the already-sparse humor.During the cast-and-crew screening for this film, one has to wonder whether there were any genuine laughs or whether the aura of the director's past glories tainted the crew into believing that they had a good comedy on their hands, thereby eliciting perfunctory giggles out of respect for their elders.In this film's adherence to the original Dracula story and noticeable neglect of comedic opportunities, not only did it fail as a good comedy, it becomes barely convincing as an A-List movie. Brooks did not need to re-make \"Dracula\". Yet this seems to be all he did Â– in a manner inferior to that of droves of dramatic film-makers before him. Mel's strong suit is COMEDY. So why were we subjected to a film about the infamous psychotic blood-drinker, so loosely sprinkled with jokes that they seem incongruous within the context of the morbid tale? Where you would expect punchlines, there are scene-fades; where you would expect a gag, there is exposition of the Dracula legend; where you would expect laugh-out-loud-slapstick, there are strained attempts at re-capturing youthful insouciance from laurels past. And the dance sequence between Dracula and Mina was needless padding. (Makes you wonder what DID make the cutting room floor.) The actors vacillate between parodying Victorian characters and actually *playing* them. Harvey Korman's Dr. Seward can almost be an actual over-actor from one of the REAL Dracula movies, whilst Steven Weber's Jonathan Harker frequently comes across as an exaggerated English nobleman from a Christopher Lee film. Peter MacNichol, though, makes the perfect Renfield Â– for ANY Dracula film, serious or spoof - and is the only actor who truly nails his role in this blunt-toothed parody. Amy Yasbeck and Lysette Anthony are just too damn hot to be funny: all the self-deprecating melodrama in the world is not gonna help, chickie-babes - LOOK AT THOSE RACKS! On paper, Leslie Neilsen's Dracula seemed like a hilarious coup, as did Mel Brooks' Dr. van Helsing, but both seemed to be laboring under the specter of their own reputations as funnymen. Neilsen playing STRAIGHT and being oblivious to his own humor is how he works best, but here he actively went for laughs, which means that even Brooks, as director, did not discern Neilsen's forte - or *did* discern it and chose to make Neilsen play against type anyway Â– either way, an erroneous decision. And Brooks' van Helsing seemed too self-aware of every mispronunciation he made - for the sake of schoolyard quotes - to be regarded as genuinely hilarious.If Mel Brooks has grown so blind that he cannot see that the comedy boat has left him onshore; if he has become so oblivious to discernment that he actually thinks this film is noteworthy enough to be considered a vital \"comedy\", the movie's subtitle may well be applied to HIM Â– \"Dead Â– And Loving It\".(Movie Maniacs, visit: www.thedunmore.com/POFFY-MovieReviews.html)\n",

      "MR. HOLLAND'S OPUS **** Director Stephen Herek and script-writer Patrick Sheane Duncan create a motion picture that is original, insightful, and thoroughly entertaining with 'Mr. Holland's Opus'. We follow the story of a young piano composer (Richard Dreyfuss), whose love for music leads him to become a music teacher. He inspires a love of music and artistic freedom in his students in the different seasons of his career while he deals with hardships at home. The story's memorable ending excellently closes this wonderfully engendered film. Alicia Witt, Terrence Howard, and Jean Louisa Kelly are the three particular students Dreyfuss connects with throughout his career, and Glenne Headly plays his wife. A winner.\n",

      "I only hired this movie because Johnny Depp and the great Christopher Walken are in this movie and i thought the movie would be a bit crap but it turned out to be really good.The movies about a man (Depp) who just got off a train with his daughter and a man (Walken) and a woman (Roma Maffia) kidnap his daughter and give him a gun and tell him he has to kill the Governor (Marsha Mason)with in an hour and a half or his daughter will be killed.This film also stars Charles S. Dutton from the films Gothika,A Time To Kill,Mimic and Black Dog and nick of time is by far one of his best movies.Over all this movie is good and it keep me entertained from start to finish and my rating is 6 out of 10.\n",

      "The polar icecaps have melted, all land has been lost below the rising waves and man has had to adapt to a new world where the survivors live wholly on the sea. Mankind now exists within several key groups: slavers, smokers, small communities and lone sailors who trade their way as they go. One such trader is the Mariner, a tough, lone man who mistrusts everyone Â– a mistrust that is proved correct when a community spots he is also a mutant and sentences him to death. Before it can be carried out though, the Smokers attack and the Mariner is able to escape thanks to a woman and a little girl. However the little girl also happens to \"be\" the only existing map to dry land and the Mariner finds himself pursued by the Smokers.Everyone knows that the critics had buried this one before it even reached a single screen. It is rare for critics to see horrible movies Â– few of these make it to the cinema Â– so whenever they get the chance to write a scathing review, they tend to take it and run with it. However as the critics moved onto the bandwagons of other years, Waterworld has been left to stand for itself and be judged on its own merits. When you look at it as it actually is, the film just sits as an OK blockbuster, nothing more but certainly nothing less either. The plot is a cross between Mad Max on water and the standard \"tough guy coming to love little kid\" things that provides a plot driver and supposedly an emotional way in. In creating a good story, it doesn't really manage it because it is too full of holes and lacks a real sense of engaging motion and characters but then, isn't that something you could say of many blockbusters.The creation of its own future is pretty well done and it all looks good even if it does lack any sense of logic. Again, I don't understand why it got such a kicking because to my eye it looked pretty good considering the challenges of shooting on water. Too many lazy reviewers (professional and amateur alike) have jumped on the \"all at sea\" line when talking about the performances and, although few are that great, lazy joking is rather a critique. Costner goes for a dark hero but misses a bit and ends up just being a bit unrelatable until his predictable sea change (sorry) at the end. He is still OK but didn't help me get into the characters. Tripplehorn is basic and her character could have easily been played by anyone. Majorino is annoying of course but then she is a typical cute kid role and nothing more. Hopper at least has fun and he does add a bit of enjoyment to the film where the others are forced to treat the material a bit more seriously; the film's high points generally come when he is on screen. The rest of the cast fill the space but don't do a great deal else but then, like many blockbusters, this is not an actor's film.Overall then, critically mauled and great fun for critics of the time but in essence it is just another in a long line of average blockbuster movies. The cast aren't great, the story is so-so, the action is enjoyable and the design of it looks good (albeit a bit too much indebted to Mad Max). Nothing special about it and mostly memorable for the kicking it unjustly received but if you are looking for an apocalyptic summer blockbuster then there is no reason why this shouldn't do the job.\n",

      "The movie is about a quick-draw contest in a small western town run by a gunslinger named John Herod(Gene Hackman). The Lady(Sharon Stone), The Kid(Leonardo DiCaprio), and a retired gunslinger by the name of Cort(Russel Crowe) are all contestants against each other, greedy idiots, and John Herod who has surprisingly signed himself up for the tournament.The movie is very entertaining and fast paced. The acting is above-average, the writing is decent, but the idea of this quick-contest in a small town was just a great idea. Its very fresh and original. I enjoyed the movie although it wasn't done amazingly well. Overall, its an exciting movie and is just a fun movie.I recommend this movie.\n",

      "MR. HOLLAND'S OPUS **** Director Stephen Herek and script-writer Patrick Sheane Duncan create a motion picture that is original, insightful, and thoroughly entertaining with 'Mr. Holland's Opus'. We follow the story of a young piano composer (Richard Dreyfuss), whose love for music leads him to become a music teacher. He inspires a love of music and artistic freedom in his students in the different seasons of his career while he deals with hardships at home. The story's memorable ending excellently closes this wonderfully engendered film. Alicia Witt, Terrence Howard, and Jean Louisa Kelly are the three particular students Dreyfuss connects with throughout his career, and Glenne Headly plays his wife. A winner.\n",

      "I only hired this movie because Johnny Depp and the great Christopher Walken are in this movie and i thought the movie would be a bit crap but it turned out to be really good.The movies about a man (Depp) who just got off a train with his daughter and a man (Walken) and a woman (Roma Maffia) kidnap his daughter and give him a gun and tell him he has to kill the Governor (Marsha Mason)with in an hour and a half or his daughter will be killed.This film also stars Charles S. Dutton from the films Gothika,A Time To Kill,Mimic and Black Dog and nick of time is by far one of his best movies.Over all this movie is good and it keep me entertained from start to finish and my rating is 6 out of 10.\n",

      "The polar icecaps have melted, all land has been lost below the rising waves and man has had to adapt to a new world where the survivors live wholly on the sea. Mankind now exists within several key groups: slavers, smokers, small communities and lone sailors who trade their way as they go. One such trader is the Mariner, a tough, lone man who mistrusts everyone Â– a mistrust that is proved correct when a community spots he is also a mutant and sentences him to death. Before it can be carried out though, the Smokers attack and the Mariner is able to escape thanks to a woman and a little girl. However the little girl also happens to \"be\" the only existing map to dry land and the Mariner finds himself pursued by the Smokers.Everyone knows that the critics had buried this one before it even reached a single screen. It is rare for critics to see horrible movies Â– few of these make it to the cinema Â– so whenever they get the chance to write a scathing review, they tend to take it and run with it. However as the critics moved onto the bandwagons of other years, Waterworld has been left to stand for itself and be judged on its own merits. When you look at it as it actually is, the film just sits as an OK blockbuster, nothing more but certainly nothing less either. The plot is a cross between Mad Max on water and the standard \"tough guy coming to love little kid\" things that provides a plot driver and supposedly an emotional way in. In creating a good story, it doesn't really manage it because it is too full of holes and lacks a real sense of engaging motion and characters but then, isn't that something you could say of many blockbusters.The creation of its own future is pretty well done and it all looks good even if it does lack any sense of logic. Again, I don't understand why it got such a kicking because to my eye it looked pretty good considering the challenges of shooting on water. Too many lazy reviewers (professional and amateur alike) have jumped on the \"all at sea\" line when talking about the performances and, although few are that great, lazy joking is rather a critique. Costner goes for a dark hero but misses a bit and ends up just being a bit unrelatable until his predictable sea change (sorry) at the end. He is still OK but didn't help me get into the characters. Tripplehorn is basic and her character could have easily been played by anyone. Majorino is annoying of course but then she is a typical cute kid role and nothing more. Hopper at least has fun and he does add a bit of enjoyment to the film where the others are forced to treat the material a bit more seriously; the film's high points generally come when he is on screen. The rest of the cast fill the space but don't do a great deal else but then, like many blockbusters, this is not an actor's film.Overall then, critically mauled and great fun for critics of the time but in essence it is just another in a long line of average blockbuster movies. The cast aren't great, the story is so-so, the action is enjoyable and the design of it looks good (albeit a bit too much indebted to Mad Max). Nothing special about it and mostly memorable for the kicking it unjustly received but if you are looking for an apocalyptic summer blockbuster then there is no reason why this shouldn't do the job.\n",

      "The movie is about a quick-draw contest in a small western town run by a gunslinger named John Herod(Gene Hackman). The Lady(Sharon Stone), The Kid(Leonardo DiCaprio), and a retired gunslinger by the name of Cort(Russel Crowe) are all contestants against each other, greedy idiots, and John Herod who has surprisingly signed himself up for the tournament.The movie is very entertaining and fast paced. The acting is above-average, the writing is decent, but the idea of this quick-contest in a small town was just a great idea. Its very fresh and original. I enjoyed the movie although it wasn't done amazingly well. Overall, its an exciting movie and is just a fun movie.I recommend this movie.\n",
