# Movie Sentiment Analysis

The project aims to achieve several objectives by building and utilizing multiple sub-models:

  1. The first model is designed to predict the genre of a movie based on its title.
  2. The second model combines user reviews and the release year to determine the sentiment of the audience. For example, horror movies experienced a shift in sentiment over the years, with predominantly negative reception in 1990 and largely positive feedback in 2022.
  3. The results from the first model (title-based genre prediction) and the second model (review-based sentiment analysis) are then integrated for comprehensive analysis. This allows for an understanding of how sentiment towards a movie varies across different genres. For example, the word "frightening" indicates positive tone for horror but not in comedy.
  4. Further in-depth analysis is conducted, such as identifying instances where a movie received high praise in the action but fell short in terms of plot, resulting in a neutral overall sentiment. This information is then segmented to highlight the 'positive reception in action' and the 'negative critique regarding the plot'.
  5. Finally, a detailed report is generated for producers, offering insights into what aspects of the movie were well-received and which areas may require improvement. This comprehensive assessment guides decision-making for future projects.
